# mixtral.py
A Python module for running the [Mixtral-8x7B](https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Mixtral-8x7B-v0.1) language model with customisable precision and attention mechanisms. [Mixtral-8x7B](https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Mixtral-8x7B-v0.1), being a pretrained base model, lacks moderation mechanisms. [Read more here.](https://mistral.ai/news/mixtral-of-experts/)

## Installation
```
pip/pip3 install mixtral.py
```

## Usage
### Run the model
```python
import mixtral
mixtral = Mixtral()
print("Running the model:")
print(mixtral.generate_text("..."))
```
### In half-precision
```python
import mixtral
print("Running the model in half precision:")
mixtral_half_precision = Mixtral(use_half_precision=True)
print(mixtral_half_precision.generate_text("..."))
```
### Lower precision using (8-bit & 4-bit) using `bitsandbytes`
```python
import mixtral
print("Running the model in lower precision using (8-bit & 4-bit) using bitsandbytes:")
mixtral_4bit = Mixtral(load_in_4bit=True)
print(mixtral_4bit.generate_text("..."))
```
### Load the model with Flash Attention 2
```python
import mixtral
print("Load the model with Flash Attention 2:")
mixtral_flash_attention_2 = Mixtral(use_flash_attention_2=True)
print(mixtral_flash_attention_2.generate_text("..."))
```
